<p class="p1">Hello,</p>
<p class="p1">This is the companion CD-ROM for CSS Web Site Design: Hands-On Training (HOT) by Eric A. Meyer. It contains two folders: exercise_files and videos, as well as a PDF file showing you how to register your copy of the CSS Web Site Design: Hands-On Training book. Product Registration has its benefits, including a free 24-hour pass to the lynda.com Online Training Library.</p>
<p class="p1">The exercise_files folder contains all of the tutorial files you'll need in order to follow the lessons in the book. The images and media files that are provided here are for you to use as you're learning CSS. They may not be used commercially or resold in any fashion.</p>
<p class="p1">When you begin each chapter, copy the corresponding exercise files onto your Desktop. For example, if you're starting Chapter 5, copy the 05_color folder in the exercise_files folder on the CSS HOT CD-ROM onto your Desktop. If you are using a Windows computer, the exercise files on the DVD will be locked even after they are transferred to your hard drive. To remove the read-only property, multiple-select the files, right-click, and choose "Properties" from the contextual menu. Uncheck the "Read-Only" box, and all the files you've selected will have "Read-0nly" turned off. You can find additional instructions about this process in the introduction of the CSS Web Site Design HOT book. Another problem Windows users may encounter is that file extensions, such as .gif or .jpg or .htm, don't show up. To make files extensions visible, refer to the instructions in the introduction of the book.</p>
<p class="p1">The videos folder contains QuickTime movies that relate to exercises in the book. These videos are provided for your education only and they may not be redistributed or resold in any fashion. To view these videos, you must have QuickTime Player installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download QuickTime Player from Apple's Web site at: http://www.apple.com/quicktime.</p>
<p class="p1">We hope you'll also visit the book's companion website:</p>
